# Quantum Collection
In this repo I have most of my interesting codes developed so far related to quantum computing.

The repo is organized as follows:

* Basic - basic algorithms that serve as foundation to others
* Graphs - algorithms that solved graph problems
* Hardware - hardware specific codes (neutral atoms, scq, etc.)
* Machine Learning - ML, but with quantum algorithms
* QKD - Quantum key distribution and cryptography
* QEC - Quantum error correction
